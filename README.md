# RKE2 cluster template

This project contains rke2 cluster template helm chart, which can be applied with values.yaml as configurations to create clusters.

### Adding the Helm Chart via CLI

```bash
helm repo add cluster-templates https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r3dl0ck/cluster-template-examples/main
helm repo update
```

### Adding the Helm Chart via Rancher Manager

1. Authenticate into the Rancher Manager UI.
2. Open `local` cluster in **Cluster Explorer**.
3. In the left sidebar, go to **Apps -> Charts -> Repositories**.
4. Click **Create** and provide the following details:

```
Name: cluster-templates
Target: Git Repository containing Helm chart definitions
Git Repo URL: https://github.com/r3dl0ck/cluster-template-examples
Authentication: None
```

### How to use

The general cluster configuration options are available through [values.yaml](./charts/values.yaml).

To provide your own configuration, modify the original values.yaml and create your own version, and pass it to helm. For example:

```bash
helm install --namespace fleet-default --values ./charts/your-own-values.yaml do-cluster ./charts
```

For different cloud provider options on nodepools, checkout

[Amazonec2](./charts/values-aws.yaml)

[DigitalOcean](./charts/values-do.yaml)

[Harvester](./charts/values-harvester.yaml)

[Vsphere](./charts/values-vsphere.yaml)

[Azure](./charts/values-azure.yaml)

### Version control

The version control is implemented as helm release history and can easily be implemented by UI to provide operation history and rollback.
